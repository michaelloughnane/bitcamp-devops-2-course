  # 1. Bot creates [Tic tac toe game](https://github.com/githubtraining/actions-template) for the learner, protects master branch
  # 1. Bot opens a bug report explaining the app is broken, asks learner to figure out what's wrong by adding some testing.

# 2. PR: CI for Node (learner)
# 3. PR: Add jest tests (bot)
# 4. Issue: A workflow for the entire team
# 5. PR: Improve CI (learner)
# 6. PR: A custom workflow (bot)
# 7. Issue: Congratulations

steps:
  # Step 1
  # 1. Learner opens a PR with a new workflow by using the [templated workflow for Node](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/master/ci/node.js.yml)
  # 1. Bot leaves line-specific comments explaining the pieces that were just added from the templated workflow.

  # Step 18
  # 1. Learner sets branch protection and approves the PR
  # 1. Action runs and applies a label
  # 1. Bot checks that branch protections are in place, asks the learner to fix it if not. Learner may have to re-approve.
  # 1. Bot comments that this action can be used to automatically deploy changes.
  # 1. Bot merges PR.
  # 1. Bot turns on pages build, drops link in the PR, explains to the learner the value on a workflow that enforces team behaviors.
