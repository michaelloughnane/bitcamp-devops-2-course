## Jobs

The `jobs:` block defines the core component of an Actions workflow. Workflows are made of jobs, and our template workflow defines a single job with the identifier `build`.

Every job also needs a specific host machine on which to run, the `runs-on:` field is how we specify it. The template workflow is running the `build` job in the latest version of Ubuntu, a Linux-based operating system.
