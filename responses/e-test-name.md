That wasn't the test name I expected, but that's alright. If you typed something slightly different than what I looked for that may explain it. 

I expected one of the following test names:
- Initializes with two players
- Starts the game with a random player
- Sets the current player to be whoever it is not

Let's keep going anyway!
