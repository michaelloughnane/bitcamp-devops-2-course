# Congratulations!

Nice work, you did it! Your workflows now contain:

- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working
- :white_check_mark: **dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details
- :white_check_mark: **access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment
- :white_check_mark: **branch protections** so that the `master` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken
- :white_check_mark: **required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates
- :white_check_mark: **obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments

## What's next?

There's so much more you can do with continuous integration, and you have a solid start. Now...[what will you learn next]({{ host }}/courses)?
