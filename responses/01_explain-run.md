## 'run:'

In addition to running pre-built actions, the workflow can also execute commands, just as you would if you had direct access to the virtual machine. In this portion of the template workflow, we run some common commands relevant to Node.js projects, like `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm test` to run the chosen testing framework.
