# Completed workflows

Awesome work! Our workflows are now complete.

GitHub Actions will apply a label to this pull request because you've approved it. This may take a few moments to run, you can follow along in the Actions tab.

Labeling the pull request allows us to automate the merging of pull requests. I'll act as the :robot: automation in this example and merge the pull request for you.
