# Matrix builds

Great work so far! By targeting specific versions of Node, we've configured a **build matrix** which allow us to test across multiple operating systems, platforms, and language versions. See [Configuring a matrix build](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix) in GitHub Help if you'd like to learn more.

I'll respond when you commit the changes in the comment below.
