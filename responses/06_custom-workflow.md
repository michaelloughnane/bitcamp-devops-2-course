# Custom workflow

Now that we've learned how to quickly set up CI, let's try a more realistic use case.

Our fictional team has a custom workflow that goes beyond the template we've used so far. We would like the following features:

**Test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working

**Dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details

**Access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment

**Branch protections** so that the `master` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken

**Required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates

**Obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments

## Step 7: Create a custom GitHub Actions workflow

Can GitHub Actions support this workflow? Let's find out. We'll tackle some of the changes to the existing workflow file first.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the existing workflow with new build targets

1. Edit your [existing workflow]({{ workflowUrl }}) file in a new branch
2. In that file, target versions `12.x` and `14.x` of Node, only
3. Open a new pull request titled **Improve CI** for your change.

I'll respond when you open the pull request.
